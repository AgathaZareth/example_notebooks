## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio showcasing three data science projects that demonstrate my expertise in various machine learning techniques. Each project highlights a different aspect of data analysis and predictive modeling. Below are the project summaries and their respective links to the full repositories and Google Slides presentations.

## Project 1: Predicting San Francisco Giants' 2023 Win Percentage
In this project, I developed a linear regression model that predicts the San Francisco Giants' win percentage for the 2023 regular season. The full repository includes web scraping, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. I provide an example on how the model could be utilized to optimize player recruitment strategies for the team. The final model provides 3 statistics that are the most predictive of increasing or decreasing this win percentage, it explains 72.7% of the variability observed in regular season percentage of wins, and on average is off by 5.81%. *(Note this is the final EDA-Modeling-Evaluation notebook from this project, there are supplementary notebooks included in the full repo that are not present in this portfolio)*

## Project 2: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays
In this notebook, I develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. This project focuses on medical imaging analysis. The notebook covers model architecture, training, and performance evaluation. On test data, the model correctly identified 97% of pneumonia cases, with an overall accuracy of 91%.

## Project 3: Predicting Stroke Risk using Binary Classification and Feature Reduction
The third project deals with binary classification to predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke. The dataset was reduced to 7 features, and I implemented a binary classification model. To make the project more user-friendly, I transformed the prediction features into easy-to-answer multiple-choice questions. This project showcases data preprocessing, model selection, and classification performance evaluation. In test data, the model had an AUC score of 76% and correctly identified 84% of stroke patients despite this class having significantly lower representation of only 4.87%

## Conclusion
These three projects collectively demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The diversity of topics showcases my versatility and ability to tackle various data science challenges. I am continuously learning and exploring new techniques to enhance my abilities in this ever-evolving field.
